eCryptfs is a POSIX-compliant \textbf{e}nterprise
\textbf{crypt}ographic \textbf{f}ile \textbf{s}ystem for Linux that
stacks on top of an existing file system.  Currently eCryptfs prevents
an attacker from accessing the file contents outside the context of
trusted host environment.  It does not impose any additional
restrictions on who can access the files, deferring to the standard
user/group/other permissions, capabilities, and so forth to regulate
access to the files.  However it is not easy to deny access to root
user via standard access control mechanisms.  This paper describes the
design to support UID based access in eCryptfs file system.  We
propose an additional access restriction to disallow any
non-authorized user.
