We have presented a comprehensive benchmarking study of BFS algorithms
and reported their performance in terms of ENERGY, MEM and CACHE
performance.  Our study found that Algo4 [ligra] takes less energy at the
expense of power.  Algo1 is the most CACHE efficient but it takes more
energy as the execution time is not optimized.  Algo3 performs best in
terms MEMORY, which can be attributed to its \emph{hybrid}
implementation.  We do not observe a clear winner in terms of
execution time,  Algo1, Algo3, Algo4 perform equally with some
variations based on input graph dataset.

\paragraph{Future Work}
Now that we have analysed BFS algorithms for energy related
parameters, to widen our understanding we plan to benchmark other
graph algorithms like \emph{Connected Components} or \emph{Minimum
Spanning Tree}.

With our understanding of how these parameters behave and their
dependencies, we plan to extend some existing BFS algorithm to achieve
energy efficiency.  It is possible that it will not be CACHE or MEMORY
optimal but it shoud be energy efficient.

%
%Don't write too much:
%- the more you write, the more work appears "premature"
%- takes up important space (small impact on acceptance)
%
%Often folded as subsection of conclusions.
%
%Describe most important 1-3 "novel/research" future work ideas.
%
%Avoid "short term" future goals.  Focus on long-term goals, well
%beyond the scope of THIS paper.  Avoid stuff that might be
%considered as should have been part of this work.
%
%Give reader some ideas of HOW you plan to go about investigating
%future ideas.
