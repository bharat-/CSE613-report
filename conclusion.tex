We have presented a comprehensive benchmarking study of BFS algorithms
and reported their performance in terms of ENERGY, MEM and CACHE
performance.  Our study found that Algo4 ~\cite{LIGRA-BFS} is the most
energy efficient.  Algo1 is L3CACHE efficient, Algo4 is L2CACHE
efficient and Algo3 is MEMORY efficient.  Thus we can clearly observe
that no algorithm performs best for all the parameters, they optimize
one parameter at the expense of another.

%which can be attributed to its \emph{hybrid} implementation.  We do
%observe a clear winner in terms of execution time,  Algo4 is the most
%run-time efficient which also makes it energy efficient.

\paragraph{Future Work}
Now that we have analysed BFS algorithms for energy related
parameters, to widen our understanding we plan to benchmark other
graph algorithms like \emph{Connected Components} or \emph{Minimum
Spanning Tree}.

With our understanding of how these parameters behave and their affect
on performance, In future we plan to extend some existing BFS
algorithm to achieve energy efficiency.  It is possible that it will
not be CACHE or MEMORY optimal but it should be energy efficient.

%Don't write too much:
%- the more you write, the more work appears "premature"
%- takes up important space (small impact on acceptance)
%
%Often folded as subsection of conclusions.
%
%Describe most important 1-3 "novel/research" future work ideas.
%
%Avoid "short term" future goals.  Focus on long-term goals, well
%beyond the scope of THIS paper.  Avoid stuff that might be
%considered as should have been part of this work.
%
%Give reader some ideas of HOW you plan to go about investigating
%future ideas.
