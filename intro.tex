\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Breadth-first search, also known as BFS, finds shortest paths from a given
source vertex to all other vertices, in terms of the number of edges in the
paths. It starts at the source node and explores the neighbour nodes first
before moving to the next level neighbours. As it is simple and is efficient in
detecting shortest path between two nodes, it is being used in basically
anything that optimizes for minimum distance in some way. It is an important
kernel used by many graph-processing applications which includes GPS based
navigation systems, Social network analysis, Graph search etc.
In recent years hardware and storage have become cheaper. So to scale up we deploy
multi-cores and heterogeneous computing units on a large scale. This increases
power consumption and hence the maintenance costs. Given the vast size of graph
data sets, their traversal takes significant time and energy. This motivated us
to explore energy efficiency of BFS traversal techniques.  Energy efficiency of
BFS/graph traversal algorithms can be improved by using certain programming
techniques. Some of the key factors impacting performance are locality, cache
efficiency, energy and power.

%Graph algorithms are becoming increasingly important, with applications covering a wide range of scales. Computers run graph algorithms that reason about vast amounts of data, with applications including analytics and recommendation systems. On mobile clients, graph algorithms are important components of recognition and machine learning applications.

%Typical length: 1-1.5 pages.

%one-page summary of entire paper: - same 4 steps as abstract, but 1
%pgf each, instead of 1 sentence.  - intro very important: most
%reviewers make up their mind early on.
%
%When to write intro: - last: to ensure it properly summarizes entire
%paper.  - first: useful as an outline for rest of work
%
%Often best to write an outline of whole paper/ideas.

The rest of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2
describes the background and literature research on BFS.  Section
3 describes our benchmarking setup.  Section 4 describes evaluation plan
and results.  Section 5 describes analysis.  Section 6 describes
conclusion and future work.
